RAxML can't, parse the alignment file as phylip file 
it will now try to parse it as FASTA file


IMPORTANT WARNING: Alignment validation warnings have been suppressed. Found 49 duplicate sequences and 13 undetermined columns

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates and undetermined columns removed is printed to file /bioinf/software/silva-dispatcher/_main/var/tmp/silva-dispatcher/932439.64050d1228b0bce75404f6cfd4bdc4bcd7f591ba/arb-silva.de_2020-12-21_id932439_sr.fasta.reduced
